# _S I D O N I A_
This is my very own repo with dotfiles, to store and keep under control, to share and
clone to my own machines.

## _S C R E E N S H O T S_
The current "home" or looks like this:
![default](/images/desktop.png "default")
The terminal emulator (kitty)
![kitty](/images/kitty.png "kitty")
The app laucher (wofi)
![wofi](/images/wofi.png "wofi")

## _H O W   T O_

If you wish to apply these dotfiles to your linux system take on mind that these .files
are for hyprland, eww, wofi, nvim and kitty, so depending on your distro you'll need to
install those packages.

- Clone the repo
- Simlink the files to your config dir (usually /home/_user_/.config/_app_)
- Enjoy

## _S O O N_

As a typical dotfiles repo are nowadays, my plan on this project includes adding a installation
script, expect it soon.
